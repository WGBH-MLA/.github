name: 📖 Publish to PyPi
# Reusable Publish to PyPi GitHub Action
# This should work, but doesn't because PyPi trusted publishing requires reusable workflows to be in the same repository as the workflow that calls them.
# https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/11096
# Current workaround is to copy this file into the repository that calls it.
# Example: https://github.com/WGBH-MLA/sonyci/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml
